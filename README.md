# GWU_Computational_Optimization_Project
World Bank Development Loan Portfolio Optimization

This file contains the work completed by myself, Josh Winters and my group partner Mikhail Flom, for our Computational Optimization
class project at GWU for the Spring 2015 Semester.

What we intended to do was come up with a hypothetical scenario where a Development Loan Portfolio at the World Bank was to be
otpimized to maximize potential impact on poverty, measured in $/person.  While being subject to constraints on budget, risk, return and 
disbursement.  

In doing this we created two Mixed Integer Programs, one was Non-Linear and the other was Linear.  For the Non-Linear MIP we were able to
retreieve a locally optimal solution after approximately 14 hours of Branch & Bound.  For the Linear MIP we were able to find a globally optimal 
solution.

To replicate our results you will need access to AMPL and the Knitro solver and the provided run, mod and dat files.
To view our results, pleas see the included excel, word and pdf documentation.
